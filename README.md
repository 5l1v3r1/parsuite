# parsuite

Simple modular framework to support quick creation of file parsers in Python. See
the wiki page for information on creating modules.

# A Note on Usage

Irrelevant output, such as `[+] Alerting on some event`, is printed to 
`stderr`. When an output file isn't desired, you can always clean up the output by
sending `stderr` to the bitbucket and use `xclip` to catch the output from `stdout`,
.e.g `python3.7 ./parsuite.py nmap_top_port_dumper -t 100 2>/dev/null | xclip -sel clip`.

                        and one or more "role" child elements. WARNING: THE

                        that the username is in Payload1. Also make sure that
                        invalid records are removed from the table file,
                        otherwise they will be translated and added to the

    moz_cookies_parser  Accept an Firefox cookie file (SQLite3) and dump each
                        record in CSV format. strLastAccessed and
                        strCreationTime are added to each record to help find
                        the freshest cookies. The final column contains the
                        constructed cookie.
    nessus_api_host_dumper
                        Extract affected hosts from the Nessus REST API.

                        don't want to deal with exporting the .nessus file for
                        use with the `xml_dumper` module.
    nessus_output_dumper

                        files: unique list of IP addresses, unique list of
                        ports, unique list of fqdns

                        values. It ingests a CSV file, making the values of
                        each field available to each template.
    urlcrazy_to_csv     Convert URLCrazy output to CSV
    xml_dumper          Dump hosts and open ports from multiple masscan, nmap,
                        or nessus files. A generalized abstraction layer is

                        structure since it has the most comprehensive XSD
                        file.

## Parsing a Nessus File

The following command will parse a .nessus file and dump the contents to disk
organized by risk_factor > plugin_name. A file called msf_modules will be
included when a Metasploit module is available.

```
python3.6 parsuite.py nessus_output_dumper -if testfile.nessus -od test_output

## Extracting IPs/Sockets/Ports from Nessus, NMap, and Masscan XML Files

The `xml_dumper` module accepts XML files from Nessus, NMap, and Masscan
and enables the user to query out interesting values in several formats:

- `address` - Unique IP addresses
- `port` - Unique ports
- `socket` - Standard socket format
- `uri` - Application layer URI, e.g. `http://192.168.1.1:80`

You can supply a port and service filter as well, which allows you to extract
proper records. For instance, you 

### Example

The URI format dumps services as a socket and leading application-layer protocol:
